## Code README

üìÇ This repository contains a Python script for sending an email using the Gmail SMTP server. The script prompts the user for a password, establishes a connection with the SMTP server, and sends an email to a specified recipient.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system. ‚úîÔ∏è
- A Gmail account with SMTP access enabled. ‚úâÔ∏è

### Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `send_email.py` file. üì•
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:   `
   python send_email.py`
4. You will be prompted to enter your Gmail account password. Note that the password will not be displayed on the screen for security reasons.
5. After entering the password, the script will establish a connection with the Gmail SMTP server and send the email.
6. The recipient email address, subject, and message content are already predefined in the script. Modify them as needed for your specific use case.
7. Once the email has been sent successfully, the script will close the connection with the server.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: It's important to ensure that your Gmail account allows access to less secure apps. If your account has two-factor authentication enabled, you may need to generate an application-specific password and use it instead of your account password.
